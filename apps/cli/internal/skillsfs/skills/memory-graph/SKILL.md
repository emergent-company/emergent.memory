Write to (and look up from) the Memory knowledge graph — creating, updating, and deleting objects and relationships.

## Rules

- **Project context is auto-discovered** — the CLI walks up the directory tree to find `.env.local` containing `MEMORY_PROJECT` or `MEMORY_PROJECT_ID`. If `.env.local` is present anywhere above the current directory, `--project` is not needed. Only pass `--project <id>` explicitly when overriding or when no `.env.local` exists.
- **Use only `memory` CLI commands** — never `curl`, raw HTTP requests, or direct API calls.
- **Always set `key` on every object you create** — see [Key discipline](#key-discipline) below. Objects without a `key` cannot be referenced by name in future sessions and require expensive UUID lookups.
- **Trust this skill over `--help` output** — `--help` text may lag behind the installed binary. If this skill documents a flag or format, it works even if `--help` doesn't show it yet.
- **Maintain the session journal** — see [Session journal](#session-journal) below. Always read it at the start and update it at the end of every session.

---

## Session journal

Graph population often spans multiple sessions. Maintain two files in `.memory/` to preserve continuity across session breaks:

> **Note:** `.memory/journal.md` is a local agent session file. It is separate from the **server-side project journal** — an automatic database log of all graph mutations (create, update, delete, batch, merge) queryable via `memory journal list`. Load the **memory-journal** skill for details on the server-side journal.

### `.memory/journal.md` — append-only log

Append a new dated section at the **end** of this file after every session. Never rewrite existing entries.

```markdown
## 2026-03-21

### Created
- `svc-auth` (Service) — authentication service, handles OAuth2/OIDC
- `svc-payments` (Service) — Stripe integration
- `ep-login` (APIEndpoint) — POST /auth/login

### Relationships
- svc-auth → calls → svc-payments
- ep-login → belongs_to → svc-auth

### Notes
- Skipped worker services, need schema clarification first
```

### `.memory/graph-state.md` — living summary

Rewrite this file at the end of every session with the current state of the graph. It is the fastest way for a new session to understand what exists without querying the server.

```markdown
# Graph state — last updated 2026-03-21

## Object counts
- Service: 2 (svc-auth, svc-payments)
- APIEndpoint: 1 (ep-login)

## Key objects
| Key | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| svc-auth | Service | Core auth service |
| svc-payments | Service | Stripe integration |
| ep-login | APIEndpoint | POST /auth/login |

## Pending / TODO
- Worker services not yet added
- Database entities not modelled
```

### At the start of a session

1. Check if `.memory/journal.md` exists — if so, read it to understand what has already been done
2. Read `.memory/graph-state.md` for a quick current-state summary
3. Proceed with the session, avoiding re-creating objects already logged

### Gitignore

Add to `.gitignore` (these are agent working files, not source artifacts):
```
.memory/journal.md
.memory/graph-state.md
```

Only `.memory/templates/` (schema packs) should be committed.

## When to use this skill vs others

| Skill | Use for |
|---|---|
| **memory-graph** (this) | Writing to the graph — creating, updating, deleting objects and relationships |
| **memory-branches** | Branch workflow — creating branches, scoping writes, merging |
| **memory-query** | Reading from the graph — natural language questions, search |
| **memory-onboard** | First-time setup — project creation, schema design, initial population |
| **memory-blueprints** | Declarative bulk seeding from a directory of JSONL files |
| **memory-schemas** | Managing object and relationship type definitions |

---

## Relationship type naming

> **Relationship type names must not embed the names of the objects on either side.**

Use generic, verb-phrase names that describe the relationship itself — not the types involved.

| ❌ Wrong (embeds object names) | ✅ Correct (generic) |
|---|---|
| `scenario_belongs_to_domain` | `belongs_to` |
| `service_calls_service` | `calls` |
| `module_contains_service` | `contains` |
| `handler_handles_route` | `handles_route` |
| `file_implements_query` | `implements` |

The object types are already encoded in the schema (`sourceType` / `targetType`) — repeating them in the name is redundant and makes the graph harder to query.

**Why this matters:** If you need the same logical relationship between multiple source types (e.g. both `Scenario` and `Module` belong to a `Domain`), use `sourceTypes: [Scenario, Module]` in the blueprint YAML — not separate entries with prefixed names. The validator accepts `sourceTypes` (plural array).

```yaml
# ✅ Correct — one entry, multiple source types
relationshipTypes:
  - name: belongs_to
    label: Belongs To
    sourceTypes: [Scenario, Module, Service]
    targetType: Domain

# ❌ Wrong — three entries with embedded type names
relationshipTypes:
  - name: scenario_belongs_to_domain
    sourceType: Scenario
    targetType: Domain
  - name: module_belongs_to_domain
    sourceType: Module
    targetType: Domain
```

---

## Core principle: always batch

> **When creating more than one object or relationship, always use `create-batch`. Never call single-create in a loop.**

Each individual `memory graph objects create` call is a separate API round-trip. A `create-batch` call with 50 objects takes the same time as one with 1.

---

## Key discipline

> **Always set `key` on every object you create.** This is the single most important habit for multi-session graph work.

A `key` is a stable, human-readable slug you control — e.g. `svc-auth`, `file-src-main-go`, `ep-get-api-cases`. It lets you:

- **Reference objects across sessions** using `src_key`/`dst_key` in relationships without UUID lookups
- **Re-run scripts idempotently** — the server skips objects whose key already exists (or upserts if `--upsert` is set)
- **Avoid expensive `objects list` fetches** just to recover a UUID you already knew at creation time

**Key naming conventions:**

| Object type | Key pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Service / microservice | `svc-<slug>` | `svc-auth`, `svc-gateway` |
| Source file | `file-<path-slug>` | `file-src-handlers-auth-go` |
| Database | `db-<slug>` | `db-postgres`, `db-redis` |
| API endpoint | `ep-<method>-<path-slug>` | `ep-get-api-v1-cases` |
| External dependency | `dep-<slug>` | `dep-stripe`, `dep-sendgrid` |
| Config variable | `cfg-<slug>` | `cfg-jwt-secret` |

**Objects without a key are stranded** — in a future session you must do `objects list --output json` and grep for the UUID, which is slow and fragile. If you created objects without keys, update them now:

```bash
# Retroactively set a key on an existing object (v0.35.69+):
memory graph objects update <id> --key "file-src-main-go"

# Bulk retroactive keying from a list of id/key pairs:
while IFS=$'\t' read -r id key; do
  memory graph objects update "$id" --key "$key"
done < /tmp/id_key_pairs.tsv
```

---

## Two formats for `create-batch`

`memory graph objects create-batch` auto-detects the input format:

| Format | When to use | Top-level JSON |
|---|---|---|
| **Subgraph** (preferred when relationships needed) | Objects + relationships in one atomic call | `{ "objects": [...], "relationships": [...] }` |
| **Flat array** (objects only) | Objects with no relationships | `[{...}, ...]` |

**Subgraph limits:** 500 objects and 500 relationships per call. Larger inputs are auto-chunked with a warning — you don't need to split manually.

---

## Workflow A — Subgraph format (preferred when wiring relationships)

Use this when you need to create objects **and** wire relationships between them. One call, no ID capture required.

### Step 1 — Check available types

```bash
memory schemas compiled-types
```

### Step 2 — Write the subgraph file

```bash
cat > /tmp/subgraph.json << 'EOF'
{
  "objects": [
    {"_ref": "auth",    "type": "Service",  "key": "svc-auth",    "name": "auth-service",  "description": "Handles JWT validation"},
    {"_ref": "gateway", "type": "Service",  "key": "svc-gateway", "name": "api-gateway",   "description": "Routes requests"},
    {"_ref": "db",      "type": "Database", "key": "db-postgres",  "name": "PostgreSQL",    "description": "Primary relational store"},
    {"_ref": "stripe",  "type": "ExternalDependency", "key": "dep-stripe", "name": "stripe", "description": "Payment API"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"type": "depends_on",      "src_ref": "auth",    "dst_ref": "db"},
    {"type": "depends_on",      "src_ref": "gateway", "dst_ref": "auth"},
    {"type": "uses_dependency", "src_ref": "auth",    "dst_ref": "stripe"}
  ]
}
EOF
```

**Key fields:**
- `_ref` — optional client-side placeholder; used by `src_ref`/`dst_ref` in relationships within the same call
- `key` — optional stable identifier for idempotent re-runs (skip if already exists)
- `name`, `description` — convenience shortcuts placed into `properties`

**Mixing new objects with existing ones:** relationships can reference new objects via `src_ref`/`dst_ref` and pre-existing objects via `src_id`/`dst_id` — freely mixed in the same file:

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {"_ref": "svc", "type": "Service", "key": "svc-auth", "name": "auth-service"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"type": "calls_service", "src_id": "<existing-module-uuid>", "dst_ref": "svc"},
    {"type": "depends_on",    "src_ref": "svc", "dst_id": "<existing-db-uuid>"}
  ]
}
```

This eliminates the two-pass workflow — no need to create objects first, capture IDs, then create relationships separately.

### Step 3 — Create the subgraph

```bash
memory graph objects create-batch --file /tmp/subgraph.json
```

Text output: one `<entity-id>  <type>  <name>` line per object, then `Created N objects, M relationships`.

To capture the `ref_map` (placeholder → UUID) for chaining:

```bash
memory graph objects create-batch \
  --file /tmp/subgraph.json --output json | tee /tmp/subgraph_result.json

# Extract a specific ID:
AUTH_ID=$(python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(open('/tmp/subgraph_result.json')); print(d['ref_map']['auth'])")
```

### Step 4 — Verify

```bash
memory query "what services exist and what do they depend on?"
```

---

## Large populations (>500 objects)

The per-call limit is 500 objects and 500 relationships. If your file exceeds this, `create-batch` auto-chunks it and prints a warning — you don't need to split manually for most cases.

For very large populations where you want explicit control, use `key` on all objects so re-runs are idempotent, and split the file yourself:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Split a large subgraph into 500-object chunks."""
import json

with open("/tmp/subgraph.json") as f:
    sg = json.load(f)

objects = sg["objects"]
relationships = sg.get("relationships", [])
CHUNK_SIZE = 500

ref_to_chunk = {}
chunks = []
for i in range(0, len(objects), CHUNK_SIZE):
    obj_chunk = objects[i:i+CHUNK_SIZE]
    chunk_idx = len(chunks)
    for o in obj_chunk:
        if o.get("_ref"):
            ref_to_chunk[o["_ref"]] = chunk_idx
    chunks.append({"objects": obj_chunk, "relationships": []})

# Assign relationships to the chunk that owns src_ref (cross-chunk rels go to last chunk)
for rel in relationships:
    idx = ref_to_chunk.get(rel.get("src_ref"), len(chunks) - 1)
    chunks[idx]["relationships"].append(rel)

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    path = f"/tmp/subgraph_chunk_{i+1}.json"
    with open(path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(chunk, f)
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}: {len(chunk['objects'])} objects, {len(chunk['relationships'])} rels → {path}")
```

```bash
for f in /tmp/subgraph_chunk_*.json; do
  memory graph objects create-batch --file "$f"
done
```

---

## Workflow B — Flat array format (objects only, no relationships)

Use this when creating objects with no relationships to wire.

### Step 1 — Check available types

```bash
memory schemas compiled-types
```

### Step 2 — Write the objects batch file

```bash
cat > /tmp/objects.json << 'EOF'
[
  {"type": "Service",            "name": "auth-service",  "description": "Handles JWT validation"},
  {"type": "Service",            "name": "api-gateway",   "description": "Routes requests"},
  {"type": "Database",           "name": "PostgreSQL",    "description": "Primary relational store"},
  {"type": "ExternalDependency", "name": "stripe",        "description": "Payment processing API"}
]
EOF
```

### Step 3 — Create objects and capture IDs

```bash
memory graph objects create-batch --file /tmp/objects.json \
  | tee /tmp/batch_output.txt
```

Output format is one line per object: `<entity-id>  <type>  <name>`

**Always tee to a file.** The IDs only appear in this stdout — do not try to re-fetch them via `objects list`. Parse from the saved file:

```bash
AUTH_ID=$(awk '/auth-service/ {print $1}' /tmp/batch_output.txt)
GATEWAY_ID=$(awk '/api-gateway/  {print $1}' /tmp/batch_output.txt)
DB_ID=$(awk '/PostgreSQL/   {print $1}' /tmp/batch_output.txt)
```

**Batches > 200 items:** `create-batch` has a 200-item limit for the flat-array format. Split before running:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('/tmp/objects.json') as f: data = json.load(f)
for i, chunk in enumerate([data[i:i+200] for i in range(0, len(data), 200)]):
    with open(f'/tmp/objects_batch_{i+1}.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(chunk, f)
print(f'{len(data)} objects → {-(-len(data)//200)} batches')
"

for f in /tmp/objects_batch_*.json; do
  memory graph objects create-batch --file "$f" \
    | tee -a /tmp/batch_output.txt
done
```

### Step 4 — Create relationships separately

```bash
cat > /tmp/relationships.json << EOF
[
  {"type": "depends_on",      "from": "$AUTH_ID",    "to": "$DB_ID"},
  {"type": "depends_on",      "from": "$GATEWAY_ID", "to": "$AUTH_ID"}
]
EOF

memory graph relationships create-batch --file /tmp/relationships.json
```

---

## Script-generated batches

When populating from source files (routes, SQL queries, config vars), write a Python script that parses the source and writes the subgraph JSON, then run it:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Parse server.go routes → /tmp/subgraph.json"""
import json

ROUTES = [
    # (method, path, handler_func, domain, auth_required)
    ("GET",  "/api/v1/cases",  "listCases",  "cases", True),
    ("POST", "/api/v1/cases",  "createCase", "cases", True),
]

objects = []
for method, path, func, domain, auth in ROUTES:
    ref = f"ep-{method.lower()}-{path.replace('/', '-').strip('-')}"
    objects.append({
        "_ref": ref,
        "type": "APIEndpoint",
        "key": ref,          # ALWAYS set key — enables cross-session references
        "name": f"{method} {path}",
        "properties": {
            "method": method, "path": path,
            "handler_func": func, "domain": domain,
            "auth_required": auth
        }
    })

subgraph = {"objects": objects, "relationships": []}
with open("/tmp/subgraph.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(subgraph, f, indent=2)

print(f"{len(objects)} objects written to /tmp/subgraph.json")
```

```bash
python3 /tmp/gen_subgraph.py
memory graph objects create-batch --file /tmp/subgraph.json
```

---

## Updating objects

`update` merges properties — it does not replace the whole object. Use `--key` to set or change the stable key:

```bash
# Update properties:
memory graph objects update <id> \
  --properties '{"status": "deprecated", "replacement": "auth-service-v2"}'

# Set a stable key (enables cross-session src_key/dst_key references):
memory graph objects update <id> --key "svc-auth"

# Both at once:
memory graph objects update <id> \
  --key "svc-auth" --properties '{"status": "active"}'
```

---

## Idempotent creates with `key`

Use `key` when a script may re-run and you want skip-or-update semantics. Works in both subgraph format (as a field on each object) and single-create:

```bash
# Single-create with key (skip if already exists):
memory graph objects create \
  --type Service --key "svc-auth" --name "auth-service" --description "..."

# Single-create with key + upsert (create-or-update):
memory graph objects create \
  --type Service --key "svc-auth" --name "auth-service" --description "..." --upsert
```

Keys are stable identifiers you control — use slugs like `svc-auth`, `db-postgres`, `dep-stripe`.

---

## Lookups

Find an object ID by type and name when you don't have it.

**`list` output format** — JSON output is `{"items": [...], "total": N, "next_cursor": "..."}`. Each object has an `entity_id` field (not `entityId`). Default limit is 1000 — enough for most graphs in a single call. For larger result sets, use `--cursor` with the `next_cursor` value from the previous response.

```bash
# List all objects of a type (table view, up to 1000):
memory graph objects list --type Service

# Table output shows "Showing N of M total" when truncated — if you see this, paginate.

# Get ID for a specific name (JSON + python):
# JSON output shape: {"items": [...], "total": N, "next_cursor": "..."}
memory graph objects list --type Service --output json \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); \
    print(next(o['entity_id'] for o in d['items'] if o['properties'].get('name')=='auth-service'))"

# Filter by a property value (--filter key=value, repeatable, default op: eq):
memory graph objects list --type APIEndpoint \
  --filter domain=cases --output json

# Filter operators: eq (default), neq, gt, gte, lt, lte, contains, in, exists
# --filter-op sets the operator for all --filter flags in the same call:
memory graph objects list --type APIEndpoint \
  --filter method=GET --filter-op eq --output json

# Paginate beyond 1000 (rare — use next_cursor from previous response):
memory graph objects list --type APIEndpoint --limit 1000 --output json \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('next_cursor') or '')"
# Then: memory graph objects list --type APIEndpoint --cursor <next_cursor>

# Get full details for a known ID:
memory graph objects get <id>

# Show all edges (relationships) for an object:
memory graph objects edges <id>

# List relationships of a specific type:
memory graph relationships list --type depends_on
```

---

## Deleting

Deletes are soft — objects are marked deleted but not purged:

```bash
# Delete an object:
memory graph objects delete <id>

# Delete a relationship (get its ID from `relationships list` first):
memory graph relationships delete <id>
```

---

## Single-create (fallback only)

Use single-create **only** when adding one isolated object after the graph is already populated:

```bash
memory graph objects create \
  --type Service --name "new-service" --description "..."

memory graph relationships create \
  --type depends_on --from <source-id> --to <target-id>
```

---

## Branching

To scope writes to a branch, pass `--branch <branch-id>` to any write command. Without it, writes go to the main branch.

```bash
# Create an object on a branch:
memory graph objects create \
  --type Service --key "svc-auth" --name "auth-service" \
  --status planned --branch "$BRANCH_ID"

# List objects on a branch:
memory graph objects list --branch "$BRANCH_ID"

# Create a relationship on a branch:
memory graph relationships create \
  --type depends_on --from <src-id> --to <dst-id> --branch "$BRANCH_ID"
```

**Common mistakes:**
- `MEMORY_BRANCH` env var — **not supported**. Always pass `--branch <id>` explicitly.
- `X-Branch-ID` header — **not a header**. Branch is a body field (create) or query param (list).
- `?branchId=` query param — **wrong**. The correct param is `?branch_id=` (snake_case).

For the full branch lifecycle (create → write → preview merge → execute → delete), load the **memory-branches** skill.
